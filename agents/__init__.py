Agents App

This app manages MCP (Model Context Protocol) agents, which are the primary actors
that interact with the system. Each agent represents a distinct entity that can
have its own set of memories, permissions, and context blocks.

Key features:
- Agent creation and management
- Agent-specific context and memory handling
- Integration with the permissions system
